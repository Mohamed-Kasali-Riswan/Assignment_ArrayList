# Assignment_ArrayList

ArrayList:
1. **Add and Retrieve Elements**:
   Write a Java program that creates an `ArrayList` of strings. Add five different fruits to the list, then retrieve and print the third fruit in the list.
2. **Iterate and Remove Elements**:
   Create a Java program that initializes an `ArrayList` of integers with the values {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}. Use an iterator to iterate through the list and remove all elements greater than 30. Print the modified list.
3. **Search for an Element**:
   Write a Java program that creates an `ArrayList` of characters. Add ten different characters to the list. Write a method that takes a character as an argument and returns the index of the character in the list. If the character is not found, return -1.
4. **Sort an ArrayList**:
   Create a Java program that initializes an `ArrayList` of integers with random values between 1 and 100. Add ten integers to the list. Sort the list in ascending order and print the sorted list.
5. **Convert ArrayList to Array and Vice Versa**:
   Write a Java program that initializes an `ArrayList` of strings with the values {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}. Convert the `ArrayList` to an array, print the array, then convert the array back to an `ArrayList` and print the `ArrayList`.
